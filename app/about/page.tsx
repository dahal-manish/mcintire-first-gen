          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-2 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
          <p className="text-blue-1 mb-4">
            The McIntire First Generation Scholarship was created in 2024 by two first-generation McIntire graduates, <span className="font-bold">Sarrah Abdulali</span> (COMM '24) and <span className="font-bold">Manish Dahal</span> (COMM '24), who imagine a world where underrepresented students have equal opportunities and a community that empowers them to become pioneers in their respective fields.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-1 mb-4">
            Initially, the two faced hardships in navigating college and the business field because they lacked the necessary resources. Determined to succeed, the two worked hard in and out of the classroom.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-1 mb-4">
            In their final semester, they created UVA's first community dedicated to supporting and empowering First-Generation and/or Limited Income students interested in business â€“ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/1gen_uva/" className="font-bold underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Generation Network</a>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-1 mb-4">
            Later, they invited Jack Banbury (COMM '78) and his wife Mary Beth (Edinboro '81), a first-generation graduate, to their team. Inspired by Manish and Sarrah's vision to assist other first-generation students, the two made a generous donation to ignite the program.
