# Scholar Images

Please place the scholar images in this directory with the following naming convention:

- `dylan-maruri.jpg` - Dylan Maruri's headshot
- `hamdael-eslaquit.jpg` - Hamdael Eslaquit's headshot
- `zayan-meah.jpg` - Zayan Meah's headshot

The images should be:
- High quality headshots
- Square aspect ratio (1:1) works best
- JPG or PNG format
- Recommended minimum size: 400x400 pixels

Once you add these images, the scholar cards and profile pages will display them properly.
